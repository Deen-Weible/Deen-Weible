# Hi, I'm Deen

I'm a High school student learning programming && computer science.

### Current Projects:

- A smart automated greenhouse control/monitoring system using an ESP32, controllable by screen and phone!
- My website, [weible.dev](https://weible.dev)
- Tosa WebDev cert, **We**'ve convinced them to let me have a couple free tries in return for feedback.

### "professional" Intrests:

- Esp32 development, making smart things that can be easily controlled by a user.
- Linux and open source software
- Game design and dev with Godot
- Electronics design and repair
- Hardware design
- Local Ai programs, Look at that profile pic!

### Personal interests

- I compete in robotics
- HiFi Audio, Current setup is UMC202HD and DT990's for headphones and Edifier S2000MKIII (or similar) speakers for movies and games. On my Linux desktop I use a pipewire setup that auto-switches the bitrate+depth to match my flacs, it's super nice.
- Silksong has taken all of my free time, it's amazing
- Additive manufacturing and 3d printing. We can make things, from titanium, using lasers... sick.
- OpSec and privacy, Keeping all my data secure makes me feel like a hollywood hacker and it's good practice or something.
- English and Debating, I love arguing (in a positive way) with others and am top in my school for English. When I use bad grammer it's because I'm lazy or _trying_ to be funny, not because I don't know better!

### Ramblings
- Did you know that contributions in feature branches don't update your contrib-graph? 
- Autonomous robots are a pain
- Nvim is awesome and stomps vscode in C++ and Python... and Godot... and Git... yeah I like it
