# Hi, I'm Deen

I'm a High school student learning programming && computer science.

### Current Projects:

- A smart automated greenhouse control/monitoring system using an ESP32, controllable by screen and phone!
- My website, [weible.dev](https://weible.dev)

### Intrests:

- Esp32 development, making smart things from dumb parts that can be easily controlled by the user.
- Linux and open source software
- Game design and dev with Godot
- Electronics design and repair
- Hardware design
- Local Ai programs, Look at that profile pic!

### Ramblings
- Did you know that contributions in feature branches don't update your contrib-graph? 
- I'm starting to use a vcs from this century (literally) - [Jujutsu](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj), its fun! Also, jj makes my commit history much brighter
